## Development Setup

To set up Socio for development, you need to follow the steps mentioned below:

- Install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Install [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community)
- Create a `.env` file for environment variables

### Step 1: Install Node.js from the [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/en/).

During the developement process, I used node version v14.17.4. You can check your node version by running the following command:

```shell
node -v
```

### Step 2: Setup [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) environment.

Follow the steps mentioned in the official documentation to setup the environment.

### Step 3: Clone the repository

    git clone https://github.com/kartikeyvaish/Socio

### Step 4: Install dependencies

    cd Socio

    npm install

### Step 5: Create a `.env` file for environment variables

You'll have to create a `.env` file for environment variables with the variables listed [here](https://github.com/kartikeyvaish/Socio/blob/main/README.md#env-file)

### Step 6: Running the application

Connect a physical device or an emulator to your computer. You can read more about connecting to a
physical device or emulator [here](https://reactnative.dev/docs/running-on-device).

After this process is completed, just run

    npm run android
